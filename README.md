# Music-player
I have created a Music player with JavaScript DOM ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ§ðŸ’¥

### This music player has a lot of features <br/>
(1) audio next previous button - user can change the song with the button <br/>
(2) audio seekbar control <br/>
(3) Volume Control <br/>
(4) Change song by click <br/>
(5) loop control -  users can control the loop Through buttons <br/>
etc.
<br/>
<br/>
This design does not work with Responsive design, only works with JavaScript feature. But design UI is good.
